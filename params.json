Yes, you may split your settings into different files and SettingsMaker will merge them into a single project class :D\r\n\r\nAll settings files must have extension <b>.appsettings</b>\r\n\r\nIn this example, the folder is called <b>domenici.settings</b>\r\n\r\n### Step 2\r\nYou add the following key to your web.config or app.config files:\r\n```\r\n<appSettings>\r\n    <add key=\"Domenici.Net:Configuration:AppSettingsPath\" value=\"domenici.settings\" />          \r\n</appSettings>\r\n```\r\n\"value\" is a relative (my favorite) or absolute path to the folder where you hold your settings files.\r\n\r\n### Step 3\r\nDownload Domenici.Utilities.Configuration from NUGet, it will be located in your solution's \"packages\" folder.\r\n\r\n### Step 4\r\nIn Visual Studio, select your project then ALT+ENTER to view the project's settings. Select \"Build Events\" then enter the following pre-build event:\r\n```\r\n$(SolutionDir)packages\\Domenici.Utilities.configuration-net40\\Domenici.Utilities.Configuration.SettingsMaker\\Domenici.Utilities.Configuration.SettingsMaker.exe $(ProjectDir)domenici.settings $(SolutionDir)packages\\domenici.settings $(ProjectName) /library\r\n```\r\nThis pre-build batch launches the Settings Maker that you have obtained via NUGet with the following parameters:\r\n1. Path to the folder containing all settings\r\n2. Path to the folder that will contain the generated library (the folder must exists)\r\n3. Name of the library (here we use the project's name)\r\n3. Type of output, where <b>/library</b> indicated that we wish to generate a compiled DLL (omitting <b>/library</b> will generate a C# class file)\r\n\r\nOnce you build your solution, the project's settings will be copied as a DLL in <b>/packages/domenici.settings</b>\r\n\r\n### Step 5\r\nCompile your project then add a reference to its settings library.\r\nIf the project's name is <b>FrontEnd</b>, you will find library <b>FrontEndSettings.dll</b> in <b>packages/domenici.settings</b>\r\n\r\n### Step 6\r\nFrom now on, you will be able to reference your strongly-typed settings from class:\r\n```\r\nDomenici.Utilities.Configuration.FrontEndSettings\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Format of the settings file\r\nA settings file must have extension .appsettings and it must have this structure:\r\n```\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" ?>\r\n<appSettings>\r\n    <item key=\"RootItem\" value=\"Hello\" />\r\n</appSettings>\r\n```\r\nWhich is used as:\r\n```\r\nstring value = FrontEndSettings.RootItem;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Specifying types other than string\r\nAll settings are returned as <b>string</b> by default, but you can override this behaviour by specifying a type:\r\n```\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" ?>\r\n<appSettings>\r\n    <item key=\"Age\" value=\"44\" type=\"int\" />\r\n</appSettings>\r\n```\r\nWhich is used as:\r\n```\r\nint age = FrontEndSettings.Age;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Specifying multi-line values\r\nAnother great advantage of this library is the possibility of specifying values that span multiple lines, as follows:\r\n```\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" ?>\r\n<appSettings>\r\n    <item key=\"Welcome\">\r\n        Welcome my son, \r\n        welcome to The Machine!\r\n    </item>\r\n</appSettings>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou may also use CDATA blocks in order to avoid escaping characters: \r\n```\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" ?>\r\n<appSettings>\r\n    <item key=\"Welcome\"><![CDATA[\r\n        Welcome my son, \r\n        <b>welcome to <i>The Machine</i>!</b>\r\n    ]]></item>\r\n</appSettings>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Sections\r\nYou can add any number of nested sections. For instance, this settings file:\r\n```\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" ?>\r\n<appSettings>\r\n    <item key=\"Welcome\" value=\"Welcome!!!\" />\r\n    <section name=\"Login\">\r\n        <item key=\"MaxPasswordLength\" value=\"7\" type=\"int\" />\r\n        <section name=\"ErrorMessages\">\r\n            <item key=\"Message1\" value=\"Wrong user name or passowrd\" />\r\n        </section>\r\n    </section>\r\n</appSettings>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWill be used as follows:\r\n```\r\nstring welcomeMessage = FrontEndSettings.Welcome;\r\nint maxPwdLength = FrontEndSettings.Login.MaxPasswordLength;\r\nstring wrongCredentialsMessage = FrontEndSettings.Login.ErrorMessages.Message1;\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Conclusions\r\nI believe this library to be useful in reducing errors due to mistypings of strings and other constants in code. \r\n\r\nI want the flexibility to change costants at runtime without having to recompile anything, and I also want to make sure that code is solid and it will not fail because I wrote \"pasword\" where I should have written \"password\".\r\n\r\nI welcome you to try this library out and to contribute to it in any way you feel comfortable with: a comment, a suggestion, a code patch or a whole tool to make it better! \r\n\r\nThank You\r\n\r\nAlex Domenici\r\n",
